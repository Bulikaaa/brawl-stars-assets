### Something about Chinese versions/Global versions
#### Global
* Some changlelogs says that `7.272` exists. But my sources say it doesn't.
* It's also an interesting situation with the iOS versions. Many have different minors. (For example, 28.189 on Android has a minor of 28.188 on iOS). We'll put together a complete list of versions later.

#### CN
* Kinda interesting situation with Chinese versions. Most of minors not even in changelogs.
* Also, in some Chinese versions, different companies are involved in assembling the game. For example: UC and Yoozoo.
* Btw, i took changlelogs from TapTap app and Wandoujia site.
* Looks like major `42` doesn't exist.
