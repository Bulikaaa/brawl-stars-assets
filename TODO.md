### CN
* 29 (minors 254, 261)
* 30 (minor 224)
* 31 (minor 87)
* 32 (minor 141)
* 34 (major+minors 133, 155)
* 35 (minors 114, 180)
* 37 (minors 240, 252)
* 38 (minor 118, 160, 161)
* 39 (minor 104, 105)
* 40 (minor 155)
* 42 (?)
* 44 (minor 270)
* 46 (minor 210)

* Some changlelogs says that `7.272` exists. But my sources say it doesn't.
* It's also an interesting situation with the iOS versions. Many have different minors. (For example, 28.189 on Android has a minor of 28.188 on iOS). We'll put together a complete list of versions later.
* Kinda interesting situation with Chinese versions. Most of minors not even in changelogs.
* Also, in some Chinese versions, different companies are involved in assembling the game. For example: UC and Yoozoo.
* Btw, i took changlelogs from TapTap app and Wandoujia site.
* Looks like major `42` doesn't exist.
